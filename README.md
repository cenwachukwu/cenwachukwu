## Welcome to my Code Abode 
- ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is Chii. Welcome to my journey of pursuing my passion for helping businesses discover and deliver innovative and successful products that meet the customers' needs in a way that is better than the competition. I am building expertise in delivering successful and sustainable products that customers love, value, and want over existing options. Whether conceptualizing a new product or iterating over an existing one, I am passionate about driving critical initiatives that will fuel your ability to innovate, move quickly, and stay ahead of the competition. I have a blog on "Medium," where I document my journey and share everything I learn. 
- ðŸŒ± When I'm not slaming away on my keyboard, you'll probably catch me at a pilates class, doing some water color painting, or hoarding Jeni's Icecream at your nearest grocery store. If I could name my superpower, it would be my ability to think on my feet. Oh, I also want to visit Croatia!
