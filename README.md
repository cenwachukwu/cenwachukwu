## Welcome to my Code Abode 
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chii and Iâ€™m interested in Product and Project Management
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about UX design, automation using python, and cloud engineering and management. With my background in scientific research, software development, support engineering, and business analysis, I have built expertise in delivering successful and sustainable products that meet business goals and guarantee impeccable customer experiences. Whether conceptualizing a new product or iterating over an existing one, I am passionate about driving critical initiatives that will fuel innovation. When I'm not coding, you'll probably catch me at a pilates class, doing some water color painting, or hoarding Jeni's Icecream at your nearest grocery store.
